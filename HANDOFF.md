# TIBER-Data — Working Handoff

## Repo purpose in one sentence

TIBER-Data stores canonical contracts and deterministic football data artifacts for downstream repos.

## Current agent workflow

Typical loop:
1. Lamar defines scope and boundary
2. Codex implements the narrow change
3. Claude audits when needed
4. merge only if the repo remains honest

## When a task arrives

Ask:
1. Is this a contract task, a data artifact task, or a repo-governance task?
2. Does this repo already hold the source truth needed?
3. If not, should scope be reduced or should the task move elsewhere?

## If a mistake or uncertainty appears

First call:
- README
- contracts
- export code
- tests
- committed raw support files

If still unclear:
- Lamar decides whether the task is honest
- Claude audits if a builder may have overreached

## Handoff note format

Every material handoff should state:
- active task
- files touched
- audit-trigger status: not triggered, Claude audit happened, Claude audit pending, or Claude audit skipped with reason
- what is now true
- what is still missing
- what must not be assumed

Example:
- Active task: extend supported weekly artifact generation
- Files touched: raw support fixtures, export validation, tests, README
- Now true: W1–W6 supported and fail-closed
- Missing: honest raw support beyond W6
- Must not assume: W7+ exists unless committed support is present
## Current handoff — NFL Draft results v1 contract foundation

- Active task: implement issue #112 by adding the first-pass canonical NFL Draft results contract, one-year fixture validation path, and documented promoted export boundary.
- Files touched: `src/contracts/v1/nflDraftResults.ts`, `src/contracts/v1/index.ts`, `test/fixtures/nfl_draft_results_2026.contract_fixture.json`, `test/nflDraftResults.v1.test.ts`, `docs/data/nfl-draft-results-v1.md`, `README.md`, `HANDOFF.md`.
- Audit-trigger status: Claude audit pending/required by repo policy because this change adds a contract under `src/contracts/v1/` and documents promoted export semantics.
- What is now true: the v1 row contract validates required draft result fields, positive pick integers, ISO timestamps, nullable source URLs, and explicit unresolved-player-ID provenance states; the future promoted path is documented as `exports/promoted/nfl_draft_results/nfl_draft_results_{year}.json`.
- What is still missing: repo-held official NFL Draft result source files with clear provenance and any promoted official draft result artifacts.
- What must not be assumed: the fixture row is not an official draft fact, no year has full draft coverage, TIBER-Data does not own TIBER-Rookies scoring or prospect interpretation, and FORGE does not consume raw draft facts from this PR.
